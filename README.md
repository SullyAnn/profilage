# profilage

## Description

This project is a web application powered by Express.js and integrates with Puppeteer for web performance profiling. Users can provide web assets (such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images) to be profiled, and the application will generate and save a trace file capturing performance metrics. The application also provides an interface for users to specify particular assets, ensuring a flexible and customizable profiling experience.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- It's recommended to have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager) installed, which comes with Node.js by default.

### Installation
- in the project folder run npm install to install the dependencies. If you don't have a script named dev in your package.json, you might just have a start script. In that case, use npm start.
- npm run dev to start the development server
- Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port you've set in your application).
